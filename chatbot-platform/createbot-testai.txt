Step 5: Chat Scenarios to Test
Try these scenarios to test how your chatbot handles different types of inquiries:
Exact Trigger Phrases:

"What are your hours?"
"How do I make a booking?"
"Do you offer delivery?"

Variations of Trigger Phrases:

"What time do you close on Fridays?"
"Can I reserve a table for tomorrow night?"
"How much is the delivery fee?"

Multiple Keywords:

"I have a shellfish allergy, what can I order from your menu?"
"Where is your restaurant located and do you have parking?"

Not Predefined Questions (should use OpenAI):

"What type of rice do you use?"
"Are your ingredients locally sourced?"
"Can I bring my own wine?"
"Do you have outdoor seating?"

Order Tracking Example:

"I placed an order 20 minutes ago, where is it?"

Each of these test cases will help you verify:

Your predefined responses are working
The keyword matching is effective
OpenAI is handling general questions properly

After testing, you can refine your trigger phrases and responses based on how the chatbot performs. If you find that certain questions aren't being matched properly, you can add more responses or adjust your existing trigger phrases.
